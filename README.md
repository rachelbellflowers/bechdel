# Bechdel

This project uses files obtained from the [Tidy Tuesday repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-03-09/readme.md), which used data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bechdel). I utilized the `data.table` package to clean and manipulate the data before exporting it to Power BI to create a dashboard. View the bechdel.R file to see my code and view bechdel.pdf for a PDf version of the dashboard.
